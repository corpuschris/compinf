    "# Weather Data Task Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This report summarizes how Tasks 1 to 7 were completed for the weather data project. The tasks included setting up directories, working with timestamps, downloading weather data, and creating an automated script.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Create Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `mkdir data`: Created the main `data` directory.\n",
    "- `mkdir data/timestamps`: Created a subdirectory for timestamp-related files.\n",
    "- `mkdir data/weather`: Created a subdirectory for weather data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands set up the required directory structure for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: Timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `date >> now.txt`: Appended the current date and time to the file `now.txt`.\n",
    "- `more now.txt`: Displayed the contents of `now.txt` for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "I repeated the `date` command ten times to collect multiple timestamps in the `data/timestamps` folder.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3: Formatting Timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S >> formatted.txt`: Added formatted timestamps to the file `formatted.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command generated timestamps in the `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS` format and stored them in the `data/timestamps` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 4: Create Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `` touch `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`.txt ``: Created empty files with names based on the current timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command created uniquely named files in the `data/timestamps` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 5: Download Today's Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `curl -o weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today`: Downloaded the weather data and saved it as `weather.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downloaded file was stored in the `data/weather` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 6: Timestamp the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",
    "- `` curl -o `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today ``: Saved the weather data with a timestamped file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensured that each downloaded file had a unique name for easy identification.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 7: Write the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands used:\n",

    "  ```bash\n",
    "  #!/bin/bash\n",
